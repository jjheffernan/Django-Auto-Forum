### What makes a Django App?
Django apps have separated logic. 
The code pattern is Model-View-Controller
#### What does each one do?
- Model Defines the Data Structure. (Often times the DB base layer)
- View displays some or all of the data to the user using HTML and CSS
- Controller handles how the database and view interact
See how they interact [here](https://realpython.com/the-model-view-controller-mvc-paradigm-summarized-with-legos/)
